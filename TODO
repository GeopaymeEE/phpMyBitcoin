TODO List
=========
 * Add an ACL (Access Control List)
 * Statistics for the network as a whole
 * Better support for mobile devices (iPhone, Android, etc)
 * Write a basic installer
 * Rewrite JSON-RPC PHP library as a component (or a datasource?)
 * Add support for the following JSON-RPC methods:
   - sendtoaddress
   - getnewaddress
   - listreceivedbyaddress (list the label on this page, using getlabel)
   - setgenerate
 * A good design, instead of cakephp's default layout/stylesheet
 * Add per user settings for number of nodes per page
 * Add global setting option for socket timeout
 * Show totals for node balances, khps, pending and generated blocks

Things bitcoin's JSON-RPC needs to support
