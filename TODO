TODO List
=========
 * Add an ACL (Access Control List)
 * Statistics for the network as a whole
 * Better support for mobile devices (iPhone, Android, etc)
 * Rewrite JSON-RPC PHP library as a component (or a datasource?)
 * A good design, instead of cakephp's default layout/stylesheet
 * Add per user settings for number of nodes per page
 * Add global setting option for socket timeout
 * Show totals for node balances, khps, pending and generated blocks
 * Show something when Bitcoin's alert system is activated
 * Encrypt node passwords saved in database

Things I would like bitcoin's JSON-RPC to support
-------------------------------------------------
 * list sending addresses
 * show unaccepted blocks in listtransactions (maybe)
 * select a range of transactions to show
